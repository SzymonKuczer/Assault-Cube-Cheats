# Assault-Cube-Cheats
My first ever cheat pretty proud of myself honestly took a lot of research and time. Ive always wanted to make a working cheat even for a crappy game so this makes me happy :D

If you are interested in making your own cheat i suggest learning the basics of cheat engine and then I suggest finding a tutorial on youtube on how to code the cheat.
Make sure you actually understand the tutorial because if you just copy it you will be learning nothing.
Some tutorials are bad you just have to sift through them to find the good ones/working ones
